Gravatar
--------

This module integrates the Gravatar service with Backdrop sites.


Installation
------------

Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.

User picture support (/admin/config/people/settings) must be enabled for Gravatar
to work. Once Gravatar is installed and enabled, you can configure the module
at '/admin/config/people/gravatar'.

You will also want to make sure the appropriate user roles have the 'use gravatar'
permission assigned to them at '/admin/config/people/permissions'.
